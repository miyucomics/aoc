I was definitely unnecessarily fancy with this Part 1. I used binary numbers because I was looking for a reason to use them this whole time, and I even got to pull out a technique called Gosper's Hack. The premise of my Part 1 solution is that a given state of lights can be represented as an integer if you let the on and off states correspond to 1s and 0s respectively. Similarly, which lights the buttons turn on and off can also be represented as an integer and the neat part is, if you XOR them, they *just work*. That is because if you had a XOR b, the result is a with every bit that was on in b flipped. It happens to perfectly work here. Gosper's hack is unnecessary since the combinations are so few as to be trivial to brute force, but it lets me increment the number of on bits in the mask one by one, and return as soon as a given mask matches the result.
