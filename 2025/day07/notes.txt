Again a deceptively easy day. My initial gut reaction was to simulate out the entire puzzle, but if you read the question carefully, you see that it only matters how many splitters were triggered. For Part 1, I just remembered what splitters were in what columns, and went row by row. If any of the beam columns aligned with a splitter, the column to the left and right were next iteration's beam columns. Otherwise, the current column stays a beam column next row. Count the splits and you have an answer.

For Part 2, my initial reaction was to make very few changes to the structure of Part 1 and instead just track the individual particles by using a tuple to remember its already done path. Rather than just mark a column as a beam column or not, I added another element to the tuple. This was horrifically slow and would have needed five quintillion tuples of length 70. Instead, I realized the only thing that mattered was knowing how many particles were in each column before the split ( each particle is a separate path ) so I just kept track of that information and the problem was solved.
