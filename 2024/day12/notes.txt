What a day this was.

For Part 1, it was a simple BFS to count area, as well as an additional check to count edges when the BFS exceeds the bounds. Part 2 was a whole other beast. I ended up checking at corners using weird half-integer coordinates and checking neighbors, with a bunch of edge cases programmed in.

There was this extremely rare and obscure bug that passed for all the examples, but massively undercounted in my actual solution, which blew the time for me to do Part 2 up to two hours.
