This repository contains my Python solutions for AOC. I may revisit this some day and write it in more programming languages like Uiua or Rust.

In this repository, I will try to find fun and elegant solutions to things. Occasionally I will have notes about how cool I found a problem or prior failed attempts at doing a problem, or just a bit of commentary.

I have a philosophy to use as few external libraries/modules as possible. A bunch of AoC days can be absolutely obliterated with `sympy` but where's the fun in that? What I will allow myself to use though are things from `collections` like `defaultdict` and `deque`, the `random` module, `heapq`, and `dataclasses`. I understand how they work and I can do without them, it'd just be tedious so I will just use Python's implementation since those standard modules are written in C by way smarter people.
