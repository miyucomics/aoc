This repository contains my Python solutions for AOC. I may revisit this some day and write it in more programming languages like Uiua or Rust.

In this repository, I will try to find fun and elegant solutions to things. Occasionally I will have notes about how cool I found a problem or prior failed attempts at doing a problem, or just a bit of commentary.
