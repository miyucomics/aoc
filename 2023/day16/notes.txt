I did try refactoring this to use complex numbers, but turns out, it actually doubled the time it takes from ~1.8 seconds to ~3.5. The optimization that did work is switching from using a Beam class to using tuples. I also managed to shave off about a half second by recording points where it exited and skipping over that because the calculation was already previously done. It can not exceed ( and is probably equal to ) the beam that caused the original exit.
