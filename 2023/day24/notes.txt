Part 2 was my absolute favorite problem of the year by far. I absolutely adore it. I was about ready to throw in the towel and just generate a few thousand systems of equations to let Z3, sympy, or some other solver churn through but I perserved and found what I affectionately call the "neat observation" in code.

If two hailsones have the same velocity along an axis, the distance between them is constant along that axis. Let's say we discover two such hailstones, a and b. It helps to not imagine the bodies as moving but rather "teleporting" between its positions. The rock's velocity along that axis must satisfy "distance between a and b" % "a's velocity" - "rock's velocity" = 0 in order for the rock to collide with both hailstones. In a continuous time, this isn't true but when imagining the bodies as teleporting to their positions after fixed time steps, it is. Splitting the problem into the x, y, and z axises and brute forcing -500 to 500 for the velocity along each axis, using set intersections to only accept ones that work for all pairs of hailstones, I was able to divine the velocity of the rock. Then it's just a bunch of algebra to reverse engineer position.

Again, I absolutely adore this problem. This is a problem fitting of a Day 24.
